# ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ The Flux Capacitor ⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡⚡ </br> (A Dynamic Lightning Network PoS Device) 

## *"I slipped, hit my head on the sink, and when I came to I had a revelation!  A vision!  A picture in my head!  A picture of this!"*

The easiest way for a merchant to accept Lightning Network payments is to download a wallet on their phone. This project however uses current merchant behaviour as its rationale. Merchants tend to have purpose built hardware devices for accepting payments. Merchants also outsource the security of some services such as email, restraints on time and technical ability make it unlikely for merchants to manage their own email servers. For this reason the Flux Capacitor is a simple, cheap device that can request and display a dynamic invoice from Lightning Network custodian Acinq Strike https://strike.acinq.co/. Once the amount of bitcoin earned over LN reaches a specified amount (ie 0.001BTC) Strike outputs to a bitcoin mainchain address, ideally a hardware wallet. 

A merchant therefore, could accept bitcoin over LN using a Flux Capacitor then have the funds root directly to a hardware wallet. The main security trade-off in such a system would be the funds held temporarily on Strike, but these would be limited to a negligible amount.
